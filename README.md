Game of Life
============

Simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in C++.

I wanted to

* Refresh memory on C++ after not having used it for many years
* Compare implementation to [one I did in ClojureScript](https://github.com/davecoates/game-of-life)
* Evaluate [SFML](http://sfml-dev.org) before using it on a more important project

Only tested on OSX. Requires SFML.
